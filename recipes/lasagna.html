    <h2>This is our families favorite lasagna recipe</h2>
    <p>This lasagna is typically made with gluten free noodles.  It makes enough to feed our family of 7</p>
    <p>The base recipe comes out a bit runny, which Allison likes.  Dad prefers it to have spicy sausage and sit out a bit longer than normal, so it gets thicker.</p>
